Martin Luther King Jr.:\\n\\nIn this iconic speech, delivered at the March on Washington in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. calls for civil rights and racial equality in the United States. King notes that 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans are still not free, citing segregation, discrimination, and poverty. He argues that the Constitution and Declaration of Independence guarantee equal rights for all, and that it\\'s time to \"cash the check\" of freedom and equality. King emphasizes the need for nonviolent protest and unity among all people, regardless of race. He famously declares his dream of a future where people are judged by their character, not their skin color, and where freedom and justice reign across the nation. King concludes by envisioning a future where all people can join hands and sing of freedom, and where the United States becomes a truly great nation.'"
